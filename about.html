I am currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I am studying computer science and working towards earning a leadership certificate.
I take pride in working hard and I love challenging myself in-order to constantly achieve higher. When I am not at school or working I enjoy running.
I plan on running a marathon by the end of 2022. I also enjoy reading. In the past year I have found myself reading a lot of philosophy, as I enjoy creative and out the box thinking.
In my free time I also like to do some coding. I have completed various projects like this website which I created using html, css, and javascript. I also developed a website for my parents business (LaBaguette), and a website for a construction company called Corgiat Construction.
Currently I am working towards developing an Android app which is a long term project that I plan on shipping by December 31st, 2019. Another hobby of mine is art I enjoy keeping a sketch book which helps me clear my mind and express some creative energy.
When it comes to Computer Science I am very interested in AI. There is not doubt AI is a huge field, and a very exciting area of computer sciece at the moment with so many applications in and out of "tech".
